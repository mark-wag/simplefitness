            A gym membership or expensive gym equipment is not required to attain your fitness goals.
            Why pay to lift weights at a gym, when your own body is a weight?

            <p> Whether your goals are to build muscle, loose fat, improve cardiovascular health, increase stamina and
                endurance, or a combination of all of them - callisthenics and adequate nutrition can help you achieve
                those goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Callisthenics is a form of resistance training. This means working your muscles against a weight or
                force. In this case, the resistance is your own body weight.
                Three main exercises target all muscle groups of the body:
            <ul>
                <li>Push Ups - Targets chest, triceps and front of shoulders.</li>
                <li>Pull Ups - Targets back, biceps and rear of shoulders.</li>
                <li>Squats - Targets legs and bottom.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-2">
            The more muscle mass a person has, the greater the energy expenditure (calorie burn)
            required to sustain those muscles.

            <p>
                You might have heard that termed as a persons metabolic rate, or metabolism.
                We can increase our metabolic rate simply by adding more muscle mass.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cardio such as jogging will burn calories for a short period of time, but if you
                were to increase your muscle mass, your rate of calorie burn (metabolic rate) will be increased, even
                whilst at rest watching a box set.
            </p>
            <p>
                I recommend starting with push ups, pull ups and squats, up to three days a week spaced a day apart, for
                example Monday - Wednesday - Friday.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider performing them in a circuit - one set of push ups, one set
                of pull ups and one set of squats. Repeat this process, up to two more times.
