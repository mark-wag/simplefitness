            Correct nutrition is essential to meeting fitness goals. If weight loss is the goal, then
            nutrition is even more important than exercise. Even the most advanced and active
            athlete could not out train a bad diet.
            <p>
                Our bodies require energy, this energy is in the form of calories (food). If we consume more calories
                than our bodies burn (metabolic rate), then that energy is stored as fat to be used later. Inversely, if
                we eat fewer calories than we burn, then our bodies have to dip into our fat reserves for energy to
                burn, this is known as being in a calorie deficit.
            </p>
            <p>
                A simple change to reduce overall calories consumed is to avoid drinking calories. Consider a
                normal coffee rather than a Chocolate Frappucino.
            </p>
            <p>
                Certain foods satiate us with fewer calories.
                Consider a diet high in protein and green vegetables. For example, chicken breast and broccoli is ideal.
                Be aware however of adding excess calories in the form of oils & condiments.

            Determine your current calorie requirement to maintain your current weight, and adjust depending on your
            goal. For weight loss goals, I would recommend no more than 1800 daily calories for the average height man,
            and no more than 1400 for the average height woman, for 3-4 months. Once your target weight has been
            reached, you could then slowly reintroduce one or two high calorie foods which you miss.
            It is much easier to maintain weight than it is to loose weight.
            <p>
                A very useful free tool is myfitnesspal. When you register, it requests your weight, height, age and
                determines your calorie requirement to maintain your current weight. It also suggests differing calorie
                targets depending on your goal. I do think however it vastly overestimates calories burned through
                exercise, as such I recommend setting activity level to sedentary to negate this.
                You can also type in a food (eg, pepperoni pizza), and it will search its database for its calorie
                content and add that to your calorie calculation for that day. Consider it a guideline for calorie
                content in
                food.
