            A pull up bar is a very effective and cheap piece of fitness equipment.
            These are available free standing as part of a frame like structure, as a bar to permanently drill into a
            wall, or simply as a door frame attachment, the latter costing as little as £10.
            <p>
                Pull ups primarily target your back, biceps and rear shoulders. Chin ups can also be performed, which
                also target your back, biceps and rear shoulders, but with a greater emphasis on bicep development,
                whereas pull ups have a greater emphasis on back development.
            </p>
            <p>
                A pull up bar can be used to target other areas of your body. For example, hanging leg raises can be
                performed, which primarily target your abs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gymnast rings (£15) can be hung from a pull up bar, transforming a single piece of fitness equipment
                into an entire gym. Using this, you can perform push ups, dips, inverted rows and split squats
                (for leg development).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-2">
            Dip bars (as known as parallettes) are available from £30.
            <p>
                Dips primarily target your chest, triceps and the front of your shoulders. Dip bars also enable you to
                perform leg raises to target your abs, and inverted rows to target your back, biceps and rear of your
                shoulders.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the absence of a pull up bar with gymnast rings combination, dip bars are the most
                versatile piece of fitness equipment available.
            </p>
            <p> As you progress, you will become stronger and loose fat weight, therefore the exercises will become
                easier. To adjust for this, you can add external weight. This could be in the form of a backpack
                containing something heavy, or weight plates attached to a dipping belt.
            </p>
            <p>
                By doing this, you will attain progressive overload, whereby your body composition changes to adapt
                to the greater challenges imposed upon it.
